Reflection: This article discusses the challenges and common pitfalls in data visualization, with a focus on how misleading information can be generated through graphical representations. The article highlights the importance of effectively combining the artistic and scientific elements of visualization to avoid misleading users. Misleading can be both intentional, deceiving the viewer, and unintentional, often the result of cognitive bias or design error. This study used databases such as Google Scholar and Scopus to review scientific publications, identify misleading examples of data visualization, and classify errors based on visual elements such as color, shape, size, and spatial orientation. The study used a variety of statistical tests, including the Cochrane Q-test and the McNemar test, to analyze the prevalence and variation of error types among these visual elements.

And the key findings are: Pie charts are frequently misused, leading to incorrect interpretations. Size was identified as the most problematic element, often leading to misinterpretation. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in error frequency among the visualization elements, with size being most prone to errors, followed by color and shape, and spatial orientation being least problematic. It also uses text mining techniques to further understand common terms associated with visualization errors and creates word clouds to visually summarize these terms. Association rule mining highlights the relationships between different errors, emphasizing the critical role of size in visualization errors.

This research aims to help practitioners, especially those new to data visualization, gain insights into common errors and guide more effective graphical representations to ensure accurate information exchange. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion and development of better visualization practices to minimize misinformation and improve data comprehension.
