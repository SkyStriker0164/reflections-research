Reflection: The paper mainly investigates the importance of data visualization in management. Once a nice-to-have, data visualization is now essential for managers to make sense of their work and managers face overwhelming data, making visualization crucial for abstraction and decision-making. To create smart data visualizations, need to find out whether the information is conceptual or data-driven. We should choose the most effective visualization type for goals. The visualization showed four different recommendations that declined in expertise level as we moved further away from the target domain to similar domains. Each recommendation drops from top expert to expert level, with a decreasing trend in expertise level as the contextual distance increases. Another shows the annual percentage change in national health expenditures and gross domestic product (GDP) between 1990 and 2015. The overall trend seems to indicate that changes in health expenditures and changes in GDP are closely correlated, with similar fluctuations in increases and decreases in both. And Changes in sales at different times of the day, e.g. desktop sales peak in the evening while mobile and tablet sales are more popular in the morning. A "pyramid search" model is used to show the recommendation process of experts in different domains. Each pyramid represents a domain of expertise and the arrows show the path of recommendation from an expert in one domain to an expert in another. This shows how knowledge transfer and expert recommendation across domains can occur with increasing contextual distance.
