Reflection: The authors provide recommendations for social scientists who want to create effective visualizations to communicate their research results. The tutorial focuses on scientific communication, assuming that the goal is to convey patterns in data clearly to other consumers of science and design philosophies discussed may not apply universally; they depend on goals and audience. Interior Components of Figures are: Clean up and understand your dataset before creating visualizations. Know your audience and tailor your visualizations accordingly. Choose an appropriate chart type based on the data and the message you want to convey. Avoid overcrowding charts with too much information. Map data to visual variables (e.g., color, size, position) effectively. Text is essential for context and clarity. The article provides labeled R code examples for visualizing central tendencies, proportions, and relationships between variables so we can access example data sets and code on the Open Science Framework here. Remembered that effective data visualization involves not only technical skills but also thoughtful design choices.
