Reflection: The paper mainly investigates that data visualization plays a crucial role in business and data analytics, enabling analysts to create tools like dashboards for business executives. In this study, the researchers explore various software tools used for data visualization and compare the skill levels required for different business school students. The goal is to understand the relevance of these tools in academia and the business world. Data visualization allows executives to make informed decisions quickly. It’s a critical aspect of business intelligence and falls under the umbrella of business analytics and the demand for data and business analytics skills is growing due to the rise of “big data.” The study involved creating dashboards using various software tools, including Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Watson Analytics to explore the functionality of these tools for data visualization and compare skill levels among business school students. Overall, we believe there is a need for business schools to explore and analyze their curricula in order to best prepare their students in the area of analytics and data analytics for the skills that many businesses need today. The use of dashboards has grown significantly over the past few years and shows no signs of slowing down, so data visualization focused on strategic business decisions is critical in today's business education curricula.
